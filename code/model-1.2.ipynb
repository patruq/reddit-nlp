       "       'Oh we like to think we are all very unique, but the truth is we are not. Men and women have some very basic instinct that run deep. Being able to understand the difference can help us when we have to deal with people. These people can be anyone, from out teacher, bosses, parents or our lovers.  \\n\\n\\nI will first speak of what men really crave. Most of you are thinking some very perverted thought now and that ok. But this instinct is in us from the time we are born until the day we lay down. It can be used to teach small children how to behave or learn new skills. Some mothers and teachers do it by instinct. But the skill can be learned.  \\n\\n\\nWhat men crave more than anything is Approval. Some of you may doubt this but I can prove it to you. A mother will teach her small boy to use the potty my saying stuff like”Mommy like it when you use the potty like a big boy”. The child gets her approval for the task and he feels good. On the other side if he has an accident a good mother won’t scold the child she will just say “Oh that ok, but mommy really like it when you use the potty like a big boy”. The child is reminded of the approval and that he didn’t get it this time. This lesson is very important later on in the article.  \\n\\n\\nYou also see how men behave and how they seek approval like a drug. Everyone knows of a man or two that seems to like to spend money on women. Even if there is little to no chance of that woman showing affection to that man. But the issue is when he does and she smiles and say “Oh thank you, you really shouldn’t have, but I love it” she is showing her approval. And that may set up a pattern of approval seeking where the man does it over and over again.  \\n\\n\\nHere is one the girls might see, a man who tends to value his male friend above his relationship. Why do they do this? It simple really he gets their approval. For years he has known these other men and the have shared his adventures. During this time they have approved of his behavior in what ever way he needed. There his supplier and they have his drug of choice. If you want to change this you need to be his go to person for his needs. Just like any other need that is not being met, he will seek out someone else to meet these needs.  \\n\\n\\nYou can test this theory your self. The next time some male in your life (be it a brother, friend or father) does a small thing that makes you happy, tell him “Oh thanks; I really like it when you do that”. It could be as simple as he picks up his own socks or does the dishes. And it doesn’t matter if you are male or female to test this out.  \\n\\n\\nThere are some dos and don’ts of this process and I will try and explain them here. I will tell you a secret that you may or may not know. Men can be the most brilliant minds on the planet with IQs thru the roof. But deep down we are simple in many ways. We do not communicate in as many ways as women do. We prefer direct language to any other form of communication. Women for example can communicate very effectively thru body language, looks, eyes and implied gestures. Men do not do well with this type of communication. For us it leaves to many grey areas and just leads us to wrong conclusions as many times as it does the right ones.  \\n\\n\\nSo rule one is if he does something you like, tell him. Use simple words and phrases that leave no grey area. The word “Yes” and “I Like That” are very powerful and simple. It can never be too simple nor can it have too few syllables. Even the simple phrase “I Love You” can be very powerful when used properly, platonically or romantically.  \\n\\n\\nThe other side of the coin is bad behavior and how to correct this. Many people think that if you yell or sulk or send the right body language you will fix the issues. This is simply not the case. It is better to correct the issue with positive reinforcement.  \\n\\n\\nSo rule two is do not scold or yell. The better things to do are simply with hold approval and tell the person you do not like it, but you like an alternative better. Again try this on simple things first as it can be a tougher process to master. For example “I really like it when you picked up your socks like you did last week”.  \\n\\n\\nThe most powerful use of this is of course in our relationships with our mates and lovers. This is where the man should be getting the vast majority of his approval. Keep in mind that if he is a good mate he will be feeding your basic animal need too, which we cover later in this document (assuming you’re in a standard male female type of relationship).  \\n\\n\\nAs the preferred supplier of his approval you need to keep the supply fresh and abundant. We hear about relationships breaking down and when put to the task of answering why we hear “It was the little things” or “I didn’t feel appreciated”. What they are really saying is “I was not getting the approval I though I deserved so I sought it else where”. This is a big reason why men sleep around. The approval they get from the external source may be compensating for the lack from his main supplier.  \\n\\n\\nNow that we are on the subject, we need to explore how sex and approval are tied together. Most men like sex, and the ones that don’t may have experienced some trauma during their first time that lead to low levels of approval. But any women can tell you one of his biggest questions when the act is over is “How was that”. Can we guess why now? Of course many of you take pity on the poor guy and say it was good. That is ok the first or second time, but you are not doing him any long term favors. At some point you need to apply rule two.  \\n\\n\\nOf course you need to be very gentle in the application. But on the other hand you also need to know your own body and needs. When you correct his technique you have to be smart. If he is doing something that just isn’t working for you at the time and you have a position, pace or location you prefer, don’t ask him; tell him. Move your self into that place and he will follow. This may require you to be brave. It can be very scary for you to take charge in these cases, but the benefit in the long run will be worth it. Just remember he wants your approval, and this is a way of you providing very sincere approval, which is the best kind.  \\n\\n\\nI will end this here and post the flip side of this essay in a few days. We will cover what women crave and why. Many of the same rules apply, but the technique is much different and harder to master. I will show you real world examples that many of you will recognize. We will talk about the “Neg-hit” and the loop that drives us all crazy.  \\n\\n\\nJust a closing thought. These needs are very strong. It is important that you know what they are and how they work. They are so powerful even if you know about them they still work when applied to you. The only real difference is that knowing about them helps you determine if the application is genuine because the person cares about you or simply to manipulate you. Not the one has any less value than the other in a given situation. Sometime we just want to be manipulated.',\n",

Pictures of all messages will be linked in the comments.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn my state, you are required to submit your resume through a Government Workforce website, in order to receive unemployment benefits. I was contacted via text today, by someone claiming to be a recruiter who found my resume on my states unemployment site. They knew my name, obviously my phone number, and the type of job I was looking for. The \"recruiter\" inquired if I was interested in a specific job title and salary, and I said that I was. He gave me a name and an email for the employer, said that I should message that email to speak to the employer via Google Hangouts, and that the employer was online now. It seemed a little fishy, but I didn\\'t intend to give any personal information, and wanted to see if this actually lead to a job.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAfter messaging the \"employer\" via Hangouts, he gave me the job description and asked if I felt comfortable with the requirements. He then asked me a lot of interview appropriate questions, i.e. \"How would you describe your work ethic?\" and \"What is your current typing speed?\" and \"What milestone have you accomplished in your career and would love to share?\". It all seemed very professional and like a legitimate interview. That is until he asked me for my full name, home address, city, state, zip code, and primary email for \"proper documentation. I informed him that I was not comfortable sending out this information unofficially and over Google Hangouts, so I asked if they had an official company application to submit it through. He told me that it didn\\'t matter, he already had that info from my resume, and that I should be expecting an email in the morning to let me know if I\\'m hired. I suspect that I will be \"hired\" and be asked to fill out fake a fake W2 and direct deposit form so that they can get the information that they really want.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI had done a google search on the company and name of the person that I was talking to. All the information I found appeared to point to the fact that this was legitimate, except I had not filled out an application or spoken over the phone to anyone. So, a quick google search of the company, which IS a legitimate company, took me to their website and contact information. I called, used the dial by name directory to speak with the person I had just been messaging. He answered and I said \"Hey \\\\*employer\\\\*, I believe we just spoke over Google Hangouts?\". To which he informed me that we had not. Someone is impersonating the actual employer by using their name, and an email address very similar to the legitimate email address. The legitimate employer gave me his real contact information to send him screen shots of the conversation with the scammer. Apparently I am the 4th person this week to call him after being scammed, and he has a legal team trying to put a stop to it. (He even offered to help me actually get a job with his company through the proper channels).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt seemed very convincing, except for a few minor red flags. If I were more desperate for employment at the moment, I may not have questioned it too much. They were offering a well paying work from home position, they wrote/replied in perfect English, they already knew a lot of my information, they sounded legitimate, and they played well on my desire for employment.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTldr: Was contacted by a new, very convincing scam. No real employer is ever going to ask you for your personal information via text or email, or any kind of chat. No matter how much you need a job, no matter how good it sounds, if something seems off always, always, ALWAYS verify who you are speaking to.

It wouldn't allow me to crosspost for some reason so I just copy-pasted the post below.\\n\\nSo, this past August the Argentinian currency crashed hard. And it's still pretty bad. Steam initially sent out a memo to developers to update their prices to account for the currency devaluation but most have either ignored the message or updated it at still a permanent, enormous discount.\\n\\nAll you need to do (what worked for me), is sign up with a decent VPN, ExpressVPN did the trick for me but I'm sure Nord and whatnot work, and change your store location to Argentina. That's it.\\n\\nAll games are at a permanent discount, due to lack of price updates, even Steam's games themselves. Half-life Alyx, for example. 59.99USD In Argentina? 650 Pesos. or 9.93 USD. With no sale. Easily beating G2A prices and other shady key markets.\\n\\nWhen games go on sale, it gets really crazy. Currently, Dark Souls 3 costs a converted measly 1.68USD. Hell, Cyberpunk 2077 can be preordered for 33$. Nothing costs 60.\\n\\nI myself have picked up around 500 dollars worth of games and DLC for less than 70$. DLC for existing games is ridiculously cheap, A megalodon shark card in GTA V which usually costs 100$ costs 23$ in Argentina. The community market has accounted for the currency however, leading to situations where you can literally buy games by selling trading cards. As I may or may not have done with countless DLCs.\\n\\nEDIT: FORGOT TO INCLUDE - IMPORTANT. If you've succeeded with changing your store, you must use gift cards only!! Unless you have an Argentinian card. Don't worry about getting ripped off on your gift card as steam uses up to date currency exchange when changing into Argentinian pesos upon redeeming since all steam gift cards are worldwide. I find this ironic since they don't even bother updating the prices of their own games like Half-life Alyx.\",\n",
