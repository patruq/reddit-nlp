when we have to deal with people  these people can be anyone  from out teacher  bosses  parents or our lovers      i will first speak of what men really crave  most of you are thinking some very perverted thought now and that ok  but this instinct is in us from the time we are born until the day we lay down  it can be used to teach small children how to behave or learn new skills  some mothers and teachers do it by instinct  but the skill can be learned      what men crave more than anything is approval  some of you may doubt this but i can prove it to you  a mother will teach her small boy to use the potty my saying stuff like mommy like it when you use the potty like a big boy   the child gets her approval for the task and he feels good  on the other side if he has an accident a good mother won t scold the child she will just say  oh that ok  but mommy really like it when you use the potty like a big boy   the child is reminded of the approval and that he didn t get it this time  this lesson is very important later on in the article      you also see how men behave and how they seek approval like a drug  everyone knows of a man or two that seems to like to spend money on women  even if there is little to no chance of that woman showing affection to that man  but the issue is when he does and she smiles and say  oh thank you  you really shouldn t have  but i love it  she is showing her approval  and that may set up a pattern of approval seeking where the man does it over and over again      here is one the girls might see  a man who tends to value his male friend above his relationship  why do they do this  it simple really he gets their approval  for years he has known these other men and the have shared his adventures  during this time they have approved of his behavior in what ever way he needed  there his supplier and they have his drug of choice  if you want to change this you need to be his go to person for his needs  just like any other need that is not being met  he will seek out someone else to meet these needs      you can test this theory your self  the next time some male in your life  be it a brother  friend or father  does a small thing that makes you happy  tell him  oh thanks  i really like it when you do that   it could be as simple as he picks up his own socks or does the dishes  and it doesn t matter if you are male or female to test this out      there are some dos and don ts of this process and i will try and explain them here  i will tell you a secret that you may or may not know  men can be the most brilliant minds on the planet with iqs thru the roof  but deep down we are simple in many ways  we do not communicate in as many ways as women do  we prefer direct language to any other form of communication  women for example can communicate very effectively thru body language  looks  eyes and implied gestures  men do not do well with this type of communication  for us it leaves to many grey areas and just leads us to wrong conclusions as many times as it does the right ones      so rule one is if he does something you like  tell him  use simple words and phrases that leave no grey area  the word  yes  and  i like that  are very powerful and simple  it can never be too simple nor can it have too few syllables  even the simple phrase  i love you  can be very powerful when used properly  platonically or romantically      the other side of the coin is bad behavior and how to correct this  many people think that if you yell or sulk or send the right body language you will fix the issues  this is simply not the case  it is better to correct the issue with positive reinforcement      so rule two is do not scold or yell  the better things to do are simply with hold approval and tell the person you do not like it  but you like an alternative better  again try this on simple things first as it can be a tougher process to master  for example  i really like it when you picked up your socks like you did last week       the most powerful use of this is of course in our relationships with our mates and lovers  this is where the man should be getting the vast majority of his approval  keep in mind that if he is a good mate he will be feeding your basic animal need too  which we cover later in this document  assuming you re in a standard male female type of relationship       as the preferred supplier of his approval you need to keep the supply fresh and abundant  we hear about relationships breaking down and when put to the task of answering why we hear  it was the little things  or  i didn t feel appreciated   what they are really saying is  i was not getting the approval i though i deserved so i sought it else where   this is a big reason why men sleep around  the approval they get from the external source may be compensating for the lack from his main supplier      now that we are on the subject  we need to explore how sex and approval are tied together  most men like sex  and the ones that don t may have experienced some trauma during their first time that lead to low levels of approval  but any women can tell you one of his biggest questions when the act is over is  how was that   can we guess why now  of course many of you take pity on the poor guy and say it was good  that is ok the first or second time  but you are not doing him any long term favors  at some point you need to apply rule two      of course you need to be very gentle in the application  but on the other hand you also need to know your own body and needs  when you correct his technique you have to be smart  if he is doing something that just isn t working for you at the time and you have a position  pace or location you prefer  don t ask him  tell him  move your self into that place and he will follow  this may require you to be brave  it can be very scary for you to take charge in these cases  but the benefit in the long run will be worth it  just remember he wants your approval  and this is a way of you providing very sincere approval  which is the best kind      i will end this here and post the flip side of this essay in a few days  we will cover what women crave and why  many of the same rules apply  but the technique is much different and harder to master  i will show you real world examples that many of you will recognize  we will talk about the  neg hit  and the loop that drives us all crazy      just a closing thought  these needs are very strong  it is important that you know what they are and how they work  they are so powerful even if you know about them they still work when applied to you  the only real difference is that knowing about them helps you determine if the application is genuine because the person cares about you or simply to manipulate you  not the one has any less value than the other in a given situation  sometime we just want to be manipulated ',\n",
